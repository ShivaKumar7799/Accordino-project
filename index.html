                <p>A front-end developer builds the front-end portion
                        of websites and web applicationsâ€”that is, the part
                        that users actually see and interact with.
                        A front-end developer creates websites and 
                        applications using web languages such as
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allow users to access
                        and interact with the site or app.

                <p>A data structure is a named location that can be used 
                        to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a
                        collection of steps to solve a particular problem. 
                        Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to 
                        write efficient and optimized computer programs.
